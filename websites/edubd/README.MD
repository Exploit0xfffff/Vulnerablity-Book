üåê **Today's Focus: The juc.edu.bd Website** üåê

I embarked on exploring the juc.edu.bd website, adhering to the guidelines set by my instructor for a vulnerability assessment task. My first step involved conducting a WHOIS lookup to ascertain the website's origins.

Upon discovering that this is a Bangladeshi website, I delved into researching information-oriented aspects like domain validation, which is valid up until January 16, 2024.

Further research using Wappalyzer revealed that the website is built using PHP.

Examining the website thoroughly, I focused on the login page. Utilizing SQLMap, I identified several vulnerabilities.

After further research, my curiosity led me to a file named `results-01022024_0740am.csv`. In this file, I found a target link.

Upon opening this link, I was directed to a specific webpage.

Suspecting the presence of a database service, I conducted research using SQL. The command I used was:

```
python3 sqlmap.py https://www.juc.edu.bd/page.php?id=1,GET,id,BTU --dbs
```

This led me to discover the parameter-related vulnerabilities in the assignment.

Although we have fetched data, we will not misuse it. Now, let's discuss how we can remedy this SQL injection and enhance the security of this website.

1. **Immediate Mitigation:**
   - Disable the vulnerable parameter: Temporarily prevent access to the id parameter in the page.php file. This can be done by removing it from the URL or filtering it out in the server-side code.

    - Implement input validation and sanitization:
        - Validate all user-supplied data to ensure it conforms to expected formats and lengths.

        - Sanitize data by escaping or removing special characters that could be used in SQL injection attacks.
    - Apply a Web Application Firewall (WAF): If possible, deploy a WAF to filter malicious traffic and block attempts to exploit the vulnerability.

2. **Code Fix:**
    - Identify the root cause: Inspect the code that handles the id parameter to determine how it's being incorporated into SQL queries.

    - Use prepared statements with parameterized queries: This approach separates SQL syntax from user input, preventing injection attacks. Adopt it for all dynamic queries.

    - Employ escaping functions: If prepared statements aren't feasible, meticulously escape user input before incorporating it into SQL queries.


3. **Penetration Testing:**
   - Conduct thorough penetration testing: Engage a security professional or use tools like SQLMap to uncover any additional vulnerabilities.

   - Address all identified vulnerabilities promptly: Prioritize fixes based on severity.

4. **Continuous Monitoring:**
   - Implement a vulnerability management program: Regularly scan for new vulnerabilities and apply patches promptly.
   
   - Stay informed: Keep abreast of security updates for the web application framework and database.


5. **Additional Recommendations:**
    - Upgrade the web application and database: If possible, update to the latest versions, as they often contain security fixes.
    - Review code for other vulnerabilities: Conduct a comprehensive security review to identify and address potential weaknesses.

    -  Educate developers on secure coding practices: Raise awareness about SQL injection and other web application vulnerabilities to prevent similar issues in the future.


6. **Remember:**
    - Ethical disclosure: If you're not the owner or administrator of the juc.edu.bd website, contact them responsibly to disclose the vulnerability.
    - Avoid sharing sensitive information: Refrain from publicly disclosing details that could assist malicious actors.
